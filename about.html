            <h2>About Jiggly Bits</h2>
            
            <p>Our journey began just a year ago with a basic second-hand 3D printer and a
                passion for creating, given our day-to-day jobs in design. From humble beginnings, we
                quickly expanded to two &amp; then 3 printers, learning and evolving with each project &amp;
                upgrade. After selling our first ever printer which did us so proud, we’re now operating at full
                capacity and experiencing our busiest period yet, starting into our first big contracts. Looking
                ahead, we aim to grow our brand, expand our services, and scale up to at least eight high
                speed printers within the next two years, proudly serving the entire Connacht region &amp;
                across the country also with nationwide postage.</p>
